# Clone

Clone this repository (example path: `~/.dotfiles`):

## Zsh Setup

## iTerm2 Setup

This repository contains my iTerm2 configuration for multiple machines.

### Configure iTerm2 to use the custom folder

1. Open iTerm2 → Preferences → General

1. Check **Load preferences from a custom folder or URL**

1. Select the folder: `~/dotfiles/iterm2`

1. When prompted **"Copy Local preferences to custom folder?" → NO**

    - We want to use the settings from this repository, not the local Mac preferences

1. (Optional) Check **Save changes to folder when iTerm2 quits**

    - This ensures that any changes in iTerm2 are automatically saved back to the repository folder
